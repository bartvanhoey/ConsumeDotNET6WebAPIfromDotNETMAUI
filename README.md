# Consume a ASP.NET Core 6.0 WebAPI from .NET MAUI

In this repository you will find an **ASP.NET Core WebAPI application** that implements **JWT authentication** and a **.NET MAUI application** that consumes the protected WebAPI.

The  WebAPI application is based upon the article [JWT Authentication and Authorization in .NET 6.0 with Identity Framework](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/jwt-authentication-and-authorization-in-net-6-0-with-identity-framework/) written by **Sarathlal Saseendran**.
